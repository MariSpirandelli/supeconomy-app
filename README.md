# Supe-conomy APP [<img src=https://badgen.net/badge/supe-conomy/up/green>](https://supeconomy-app.vercel.app/)

It's an app where people can find best prices of products and stores nearby as well as register their purchases to update prices and keep track of their expenses as well as creating a social network for looking for best deals.

To walk through, just pretend you're logging in. It's all mocked for now.

- **It was created for Brazilian environment**
- **This version is a mocked version for UX UI proposal**
- **API can be found in another repository (private yet)**
